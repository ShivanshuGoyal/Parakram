<li>All the matches will be of T20 format with 6 overs of Power-play.</li>

<li>All teams must report 30 min before the scheduled time.
If any or both teams are not ready before the scheduled time, umpires reserve the right to take appropriate action.</li>

<li>A match must be of minimum 6 (for T20) overs per side in order to be accepted as an official game.
